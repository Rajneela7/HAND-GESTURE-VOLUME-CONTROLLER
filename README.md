# HAND-GESTURE-VOLUME-CONTROLLER
          A hand gesture recognition system provides a natural, innovative and modern way of non verbal communication. It has a wide area of application in human computer interaction and sign language. The intention of this implementation is to discuss approach of hand gesture recognition based on detection of some shape based features. A primary goal of gesture recognition is to create a system which can identify specific human gestures and use them to convey information for device control and by implementing real time gestures recognition a user can control a computer by doing a specific gesture in front of a video camera linked to a computer.
